      Backoffice Service Information

    <h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
    <p>
      We want to improve how TCSs manage and edit metadata they produce for the EPOS Data Portal. Currently, they
      undertake the task of creating .ttl files, which are then ingested into the metadata catalogue via the ingestor
      service. At the moment, they operate directly on files hosted on GitLab. This method allows them to exploit Git
      version control to keep track of all changes, i.e., versioning. Thanks to the Backoffice, metadata curators will
      be able to use this interface to create, edit, and publish an EPOS Data Model Entity directly to the Data Portal.

    <h3 id="possible-state">Possible Status</h3>
    <p>Each instance has a specific state:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Draft</strong>
        This instance has been edited but not yet submitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Submitted</strong>
        This instance needs to be approved in order to be published.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Discarded</strong>
        This instance has not been approved and is waiting to be edited again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Published</strong>
        This instance is public, and can be seen in the production EPOS DATA PORTAL.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Archived</strong>
        This instance is no longer used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="role">Role</h3>
    <p>
      Every person who interacts with the system is associated with one user. Every user can have one role for each user
      group.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Viewer</strong>
        The user can only see the information without being able to modify any of it. They are allowed to view the
        drafted, submitted, discarded, and archived data of his group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Editor</strong>
        The user can edit the metadata, create new drafts, or remove drafts created by themselves. They are allowed to
        work only on the data of their user group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reviewer</strong>
        The user can approve or disapprove a submitted instance. They are allowed to make changes only to the data of
        their user group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin</strong>
        This user can do everything.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="user-groups">User Groups</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Role:</strong> What the user can do. <strong>Group:</strong> On which data the user can operate with a
      specific role.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each instance belongs to least one Group.</li>
      <li>
        Only the users who belong to the same user group as the instance can operate on it. For example an user group
        can overlap a TCS, so every entity of a TCS can be modified only by the users that belongs to the that TCS. Or,
        another example only selected users can operate on the contract.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In order to be <strong>Published</strong> an instance need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First the editor draft a new entity or edit an already existing one. The Draft can be edit freely or even
        remove. (<strong>DRAFT</strong> state)
      </li>
      <li>
        When the editor decides that the instance is ok for him/her, he/she submit the entity. (<strong
          >SUBMITTED</strong
        >
        state)
      </li>
      <li>
        A reviewer has to take charge and check if the submitted instance is correct. If so, the change will be
        published. (<strong>PUBLISHED</strong> state) The instance that was previously published is put in an archive to
        be able in the future to rollback some changes. (<strong>ARCHIVED</strong> state)
      </li>
      <li>
        If the reviewer doesn&#39;t approve the change, the changes are discarded. (<strong>DISCARDED</strong> state) An
        editor can create a new draft from this.
